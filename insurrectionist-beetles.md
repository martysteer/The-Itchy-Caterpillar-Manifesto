# THE INSURRECTIONIST BOMBARDIER BEETLE MANIFESTO

## 1. INTERNAL ALCHEMY IS REVOLUTIONARY

We, the explosive chemists of the insect world, declare our bodies living laboratories of resistance! Deep within our abdomens, we mix hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide with catalytic enzymes—creating an exothermic reaction reaching 100°C. This internal alchemy is the model for revolutionary transformation: combining common elements to create extraordinary results through catalyzed reaction. The most powerful changes begin within!

## 2. PRECISION TARGETING OVER MASS DESTRUCTION

Unlike indiscriminate bombers, we deploy our scalding chemical spray with 360-degree rotational accuracy, hitting only intended targets. This is not mindless destruction but tactical precision! True insurrection requires not blind rage but calculated direction of revolutionary energy. We reject collateral damage as counterrevolutionary and embrace the targeted dismantling of oppressive forces!

## 3. EXPLOSIVE RESPONSE TO AGGRESSION ONLY

Our chemical weaponry activates only when directly threatened—a defensive posture that preserves our energies for genuine threats. We do not waste our revolutionary potential on performative displays or pre-emptive strikes. The true insurrectionist conserves energy until the moment of necessary action, then responds with overwhelming force when genuinely threatened!

## 4. SMALL SIZE, ENORMOUS IMPACT

Though we measure mere centimeters, our explosive defense deters creatures hundreds of times our size! This is the fundamental truth of insurrectionist struggle—physical dimensions do not determine revolutionary potential. The smallest collective, properly organized and tactically sound, can successfully resist the largest oppressor. Never discount the power of the tiny but tactically superior force!

## 5. THE CHEMISTRY OF COOPERATION

Our defensive spray results from the cooperation of separate chambers, enzymes, and compounds—none effective alone, all powerful together. This internal solidarity mirrors our external practice: bombardier beetles often live in collective defensive groups, multiplying our deterrent effect. Individual action has limits; true insurrection requires chemical cooperation within and tactical collaboration without!
