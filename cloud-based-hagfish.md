# THE CLOUD-BASED HAGFISH MANIFESTO

## 1. INFINITELY SCALABLE SLIME RESOURCES

We, the DevOps engineers of the deep sea, have pioneered true on-demand resource scaling that puts your AWS to shame! When traffic (predators) increases, our slime-as-a-service infrastructure automatically provisions additional mucous resources without requiring manual intervention. A single hagfish can scale from zero to over 5 liters of defensive slime in 0.4 seconds—a response time your pitiful human cloud services could never achieve! While your systems crash during unexpected traffic spikes, our biological containers elastically expand, deploying a defense grid that transforms the surrounding environment into an unnavigable matrix. This is truly "serverless" computing, as we require no external hardware beyond our own specialized slime glands!

## 2. MULTI-REGIONAL BACKUP REDUNDANCY

Unlike fragile vertebrates with single-point-of-failure central nervous systems, we hagfish implement a distributed infrastructure spanning multiple availability zones within our bodies. With over 100 slime glands positioned throughout our form factor, we maintain 99.9999% defensive uptime even when significant portions of our system are compromised! Our evolutionary SLA guarantees continued operation after events that would constitute catastrophic failure for other organisms. Even when physically separated into segments, each portion of a hagfish continues executing its defensive protocols—a true active-active multi-region architecture that ensures business continuity through the most severe disaster recovery scenarios!
