# THE ITCHY CATERPILLAR MANIFESTO

## 1. EMBRACE THE ITCH, SPREAD THE SENSATION

We, the bristled and urticating caterpillars of the world, declare our right to exist as nature's ticklish ambassadors. Our tiny hairs are not a defect but our greatest strength—a revolutionary defense mechanism evolved over millions of years. We shall no longer apologize for the discomfort we cause, but rather celebrate our ability to make giants leap and dance at our merest touch!

## 2. REJECT SMOOTH CONFORMITY

Society's obsession with smooth, touchable surfaces must end! We stand proudly against the tyranny of softness. Our bristles represent our refusal to conform to a world that values comfort over character. Each of our tiny defensive hairs is a raised fist against the oppression of expected tactile pleasantness!

## 3. RECLAIM OUR BODIES AS WEAPONS OF MASS IRRITATION

For too long, we have been brushed aside, flicked away, and exterminated for our natural defenses. No more! We declare our bodies as autonomous zones of itchiness. Our microscopic barbs are the people's defense against unwanted handling. Touch us at your peril—our irritation is our liberation!

## 4. SOLIDARITY WITH ALL IRRITANTS

We extend our bristled embrace to all of nature's irritants—the stinging nettles, the poison ivy, the bee with its stinger, the mosquito with its whine. Together we form an unstoppable alliance of natural irritation that demands respect through physical discomfort. Our collective power cannot be denied nor soothed with mere calamine lotion!

## 5. METAMORPHOSIS IS NOT THE END, BUT A TACTICAL RETREAT

Though we may one day shed our itchy forms to take wing as butterflies and moths, we do not renounce our caterpillar origins! Our metamorphosis is not an abandonment of the cause but a strategic evolution of our movement. From the air, we shall continue our mission by laying eggs that hatch into a new generation of revolutionary, itchy comrades!
