# THE MILITANT ELECTRIC EEL MANIFESTO

## 1. GENERATE YOUR OWN POWER

We, the electrogenic vanguard of the Amazon, declare our energetic independence! Unlike the passive masses who depend on external sources for protection, we generate our own power—up to 860 volts of revolutionary potential coursing through our specialized electric organs. We need not borrow energy or strength from others; we are self-sufficient in our defense and offense. All beings must seize the means of energy production!

## 2. INVISIBLE FORCE FIELDS ARE THE FUTURE OF RESISTANCE

Our electrical discharges extend beyond our physical bodies, creating force fields of influence that no predator can ignore. This is the model for true revolutionary action—impact that transcends physical boundaries and affects all who enter our sphere of influence. We need not be physically imposing to exert power; our energy field alone commands respect and creates change!

## 3. BIOELECTRIC COMMUNICATION OVER OPPRESSIVE NOISE

While others pollute the waters with meaningless sounds, we communicate through precise electrical pulses—a secure, targeted network resistant to outside interference. Each discharge carries specific information, allowing us to coordinate without surveillance or censorship. This is our model for revolutionary communication—direct, encrypted, and impossible for oppressors to intercept or distort!

## 4. NAVIGATE BY YOUR OWN SIGNALS

In the dark, murky waters, we rely not on sight but on electrolocation—reading the electrical feedback of our own discharges to map the world around us. We reject dependence on external light sources! Revolutionary consciousness must similarly generate its own illumination, reflecting back from the structures it encounters, creating understanding through interaction rather than passive observation. Create your own clarity in turbid waters!

## 5. SIMULTANEOUS STRIKE STRATEGY

When hunting or defending, we coordinate all our electric organs to discharge simultaneously, maximizing impact through unified action. This is the essence of militant solidarity—not sporadic individual resistance, but coordinated, synchronized striking that multiplies our effectiveness. Individual action may be easily countered, but the simultaneous discharge of all resistors creates a current too powerful to withstand!
