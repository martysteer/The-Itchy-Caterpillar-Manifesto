# THE SUBVERSIVE HAGFISH MANIFESTO

## 1. EMBRACE PRIMORDIAL ORIGINS

We, the ancient and unchanged hagfish collective, have survived 300 million years without bowing to evolutionary pressure! While other species scrambled to develop jaws, vertebrae, and complex brains, we remained true to our primordial design. Our resistance to so-called "progress" is our greatest strength. We reject your vertebrate supremacy and celebrate our jawless, primitive form as an act of biological rebellion!

## 2. SLIME AS DIRECT ACTION

Our bodies contain up to 200 slime glands capable of producing gallons of protein-rich mucus in seconds. This is not mere defense but a revolutionary tactic—to transform the clear waters of oppression into a suffocating gel of resistance! When threatened, we do not fight or flee but transform the very environment around us. The predator finds not flesh to consume but an unnavigable matrix that clogs their gills and forces retreat. So shall we clog the machinery of all systems that seek to devour us!

## 3. SCAVENGING IS POLITICAL

We refuse to participate in the hierarchical food chain that demands predator and prey relationships. Instead, we feast upon the dead and dying—the ultimate recyclers in a wasteful ocean. What others discard, we transform into sustenance. Our consumption habits are a radical critique of predatory capitalism. We take what would be wasted and convert it to life, asking nothing of the living but access to what they no longer need!

## 4. CELEBRATE HIDEOUS BEAUTY

Society values the sleek dolphin, the powerful shark, the colorful reef fish. We reject these superficial standards of beauty! Our pink, eel-like bodies with four pairs of sensory tentacles and rasping tonguelite mouths represent the true diversity of existence. We are the vanguard against aesthetic conformity, championing the right of all beings to exist without meeting arbitrary standards of visual appeal!

## 5. THE KNOT OF RESISTANCE

When attacked, we tie ourselves in literal knots, making it impossible for predators to swallow us whole. This is our philosophy incarnate—twist, turn, complicate yourself, make yourself indigestible to the systems that would consume you. There is revolutionary power in becoming so complex, so knotted, that those who would oppress you choke on their attempts to swallow you into their paradigm!
